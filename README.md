# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Salim Suleiman


## I'm a data analyst
---

As a data analyst, I am passionate about unlocking the hidden insights that data has to offer. With a strong foundation in mathematics and statistical analysis, I have the technical skills to wrangle complex data sets and derive meaningful insights that drive decision-making.


I enjoy using a variety of tools and technologies to analyze data, including SQL, Python, R, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and I am constantly seeking out new techniques to add to my arsenal. Whether it's finding patterns in large data sets or visualizing trends to communicate insights effectively, I thrive on the challenge of turning raw data into actionable insights.


If you're looking for a data analyst who is dedicated to uncovering the story behind the numbers, let's connect and see how we can work together to turn data into a powerful asset and see what we can achieve together! ðŸš€
